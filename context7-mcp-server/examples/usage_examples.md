## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include specific requirements and constraints in your prompts
2. **Use Topics**: When you need focused documentation, specify a topic
3. **Combine Libraries**: Ask for integration examples between multiple libraries
4. **Include Context**: Mention your project type, tech stack, and requirements
5. **Error Handling**: Always ask for proper error handling and edge cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Library Not Found**: Try different variations of the library name
2. **Outdated Information**: The server fetches live documentation, but some sources may have delays
3. **Rate Limiting**: If you encounter rate limits, wait a moment before retrying
