- **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing, code review, and documentation required for each phase
- **Best Practices**: Follow industry standards, security guidelines, and performance benchmarks
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines from Phase 1
- **Documentation**: Living documentation updated throughout each phase

## Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:
- ✅ **All tasks completed** with code review approval
- ✅ **Automated tests passing** (unit, integration, e2e where applicable)
- ✅ **Performance benchmarks met** for phase-specific metrics
- ✅ **Security review completed** and vulnerabilities addressed
- ✅ **Documentation updated** including implementation notes and lessons learned
- ✅ **Stakeholder sign-off** on phase deliverables
