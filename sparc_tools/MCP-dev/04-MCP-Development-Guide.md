# MCP Development Guide

This guide provides an overview of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and detailed instructions for setting up and using key MCP servers for enhanced AI-assisted development.

## Introduction to MCP

MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is a standard designed to enable seamless communication between AI models and development tools. It aims to reduce fragmentation and allows MCP servers to act as an "App Store" for AI agents and workflows.

## Core Setup

Setting up a local MCP development environment involves installing prerequisites, cloning server repositories, installing dependencies, building TypeScript projects, and configuring MCP settings in your IDE.

For detailed instructions on the core setup, refer to:
- [01-VSCode-local-setup.md](./01-VSCode-local-setup.md)

## VS Code Insiders & GitHub MCP

This section covers setting up VS Code Insiders and configuring a GitHub MCP server to enhance GitHub tool access via AI agents.

For detailed instructions on setting up the GitHub MCP server in VS Code Insiders, refer to:
- [02-VSCode_Insiders_MCP.md](./02-VSCode_Insiders_MCP.md)

## Context7 Setup Overview

Context7 MCP is designed to provide AI models with up-to-date, version-specific documentation to prevent hallucinations and outdated code examples.

For detailed instructions on setting up and using Context7, refer to:
- [03-context-7-setup.md](./03-context-7-setup.md)
- [Context7 Setup Guide](./Context7-Setup.md)

## Key MCP Servers Overview

Several key MCP servers offer specialized capabilities to enhance your development workflow.

### Sequential Thinking MCP

The Sequential Thinking MCP helps AI reason through complex problems step-by-step, supporting structured and reflective problem-solving.

### Brave Search MCP

The Brave Search MCP integrates the Brave Search API into your workflow, providing access to real statistics, fresh data, and relevant documents directly within your AI-assisted environment.

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the Brave Search MCP, refer to:
- [Brave Search Setup Guide](./06-Brave-Search-Setup.md)

### Knowledge Graph Memory

The Knowledge Graph Memory server provides a basic implementation of persistent memory using a local knowledge graph, allowing AI agents to remember information across sessions.

For detailed instructions on setting up and using the Knowledge Graph Memory server, refer to:
- [Knowledge Graph Memory Setup Guide](./07-Knowledge-Graph-Memory-Setup.md)

### Magic UI MCP & 21st Dev's Magic MCP

Magic UI MCP and 21st Dev's Magic MCP are UI component generators that allow you to create modern UI components instantly through natural language descriptions.

For detailed instructions on setting up and using Magic UI MCP, refer to:
- [Magic UI Setup Guide](./08-Magic-UI-Setup.md)

## Conclusion

By leveraging MCP and these specialized servers, developers can significantly enhance their AI-assisted development workflows, leading to more accurate code, faster problem-solving, and improved efficiency.
