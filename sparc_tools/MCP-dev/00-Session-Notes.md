# üìö MCP Recap

**What is MCP?**  
- MCP = Model Context Protocol.
- A *standard* that allows AI models and tools to communicate seamlessly.
- Removes "fragmentation" between tools.
- MCP servers act like an "App Store" for AI agents and workflows.

# üìö Top MCP Servers for developers

**Goal of Session:**  
- Introduce **Top MCP Servers**
- Focus on *what* they are, *how* to access them, and *why* they're valuable.
- High-level; not deep technical setup.

## 1. Context 7
**Purpose:**  
- Fixes bad documentation context inside AI IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf.
- Solves hallucination issues with new APIs (e.g., Supabase).

**How to Use:**
1. Access [Context7.com](https://context7.com) (link inferred).
2. Integrate it into your vibe coding setup (e.g., Cursor).
3. When coding (e.g., "create a user table in Supabase"):
   - It fetches live documentation into the coding context.
4. AI writes code based on **current**, **real** documentation.

**Benefit:**  
- Saves hours of debugging hallucinated APIs.
- Speeds up using fast-evolving third-party tools.

## 2. Sequential Thinking MCP
**Purpose:**  
- Helps AI reason through complex problems **step-by-step**.
- Supports structured, reflective problem solving.

**How to Use:**
1. Add Sequential Thinking server into your MCP configuration.
2. When designing complex features:
   - Prompt: "Break this down into detailed thought steps."
3. The system will:
   - Generate a sequence of logical steps.
   - Revise earlier steps as new ideas come up.
   - Branch into alternative reasoning if needed.

**Benefit:**  
- Converts vague goals into **clear step-by-step strategies**.
- Perfect for planning apps, solving bugs, or AI agent task flows.

## 3. Brave Search MCP
**Purpose:**  
- AI-powered web search engine integrated into workflows.
- Pulls **real statistics**, **fresh data**, **relevant documents**.

**How to Use:**
1. Integrate Brave Search MCP into your workspace.
2. When your agent needs information:
   - Highlight section needing research.
   - Command: "Use Brave Search to find supporting data."
3. Brave will:
   - Search web.
   - Return reliable, up-to-date results.
4. Agent integrates findings into your application.

**Benefit:**  
- Controls the quality of AI context.
- Reduces hallucinated or fake facts inside outputs.

## 4. Knowledge Graph Memory (by Model Context Protocol / Anthropic)
**Purpose:**  
- Adds "long-term memory" to your projects.
- Helps with complex relationships and state management across sessions.

**How to Use:**
1. When building apps:
   - Identify key memory needs (themes, relationships, states).
2. Command examples:
   - "Store Light/Dark theme variables into memory."
   - "Track database entity relationships."
3. It saves observations and links between pieces of information.
4. When future tasks reference past decisions, the system recalls correctly.

**Benefit:**  
- Manage complexity easily over time.
- Ensures correct behavior even after long breaks.

---

## 5. Magic UI MCP & 21st Dev's Magic MCP
**Purpose:**  
- **UI component generators** using MCP servers.
- Focus on beautiful, authority-building designs without manual Figma work.

**How to Use:**
1. Browse available UI components on Magic UI / 21st Dev platforms.
2. Choose desired component (e.g., flickering grid background).
3. Add the file/section into context.
4. Command: "Use Magic UI to apply flickering grid background."
5. Prompt for adjustments (opacity, color, etc.) if needed.

**Benefit:**  
- Professional UI without manual front-end coding.
- Authority and credibility through better design.
