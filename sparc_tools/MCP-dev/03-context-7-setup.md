## 2. Ways to Install Context7 MCP Server

You have **two main options** depending on your setup:

| Method                           | Description                                      |
|:----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Manual JSON Install               | Add Context7 manually to your MCP config file    |
| One-Click Marketplace Install     | Install Context7 directly from the MCP Marketplace inside Cline |

---

## 3. Method 1: Manual JSON Installation

### 3.1 Get the Context7 MCP JSON

- Go to the Context7 GitHub page.
- Copy the JSON snippet provided.

### 3.2 Add to MCP Configuration

**For Windsurf / Cursor / Cloud Code / Root Code:**

1. Open your IDE's MCP server configuration file.
2. If you have other servers listed, add a **comma** after the last entry.
3. Paste in the new Context7 JSON.
4. Save the file.

Done!

### 3.3 Special Setup for VS Code

> VS Code needs MCPs added slightly differently.

**Steps:**

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
2. Search for **"MCP: Add Server"**.
3. Choose connection type **STDIO**.
4. In the command field, type:

   ```bash
   npx -y [paste your MCP command here]
   ```

5. Give it a name like `Context7`. Avoid something hilarious you'll regret later.
6. Restart VS Code (the universal solution to all technical problems).

VS Code will now recognize the Context7 MCP server. You can also trust MCP servers installed by other clients like Cursor or Windsurf without having to reinstall anything.

## 4. Marketplace Installation via Cline (Recommended)

Installing Context7 using Cline is suspiciously easy. Proceed anyway.

1. Open Cline.
2. Navigate to the MCP Marketplace tab.
3. Locate **Context7**.
4. Click **Install**.
5. Watch as decades of sysadmin trauma melt away.

_No config editing. No misplaced commas. Just pure, uncut documentation access._

## 5. Getting a Free API Key for Setup (Optional)

If you want to use Context7 with free LLMs like Google Gemini:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. Click **Get API Key** and follow the process.
3. Go back to Cline.
4. Paste the API key into the API Key field in Settings.

Now you have all the power and none of the billing surprises.

## 6. How to Use Context7 in Your IDE

Once installed, Context7 becomes your personal documentation whisperer.

**Example Prompt:**

> Use Context7 to fetch the latest Next.js createRouteHandler documentation.

The MCP server will:

- Fetch the freshest documentation.
- Actually know what it's talking about.
- Save you from typing `Next.js createRouteHandler site:stackoverflow.com` at 2AM.

**Supported clients:**

- Cursor
- Windsurf
- VS Code
- Cloud Desktop
- Root Code
- Cline

## 7. Managing and Uninstalling Context7

**Inside Cline:**

- Open the MCP Installed Servers section.
- You can:
  - Deactivate Context7
  - Restart it if it gets grumpy
  - Delete it if you must (goodbyes are hard)

Other IDEs allow manual removal from their MCP server configuration files.
