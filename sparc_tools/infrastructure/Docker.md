# üê≥ Docker: Containerization Platform

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside **containers**. Containers package an application and all its dependencies (libraries, system tools, code, runtime) together, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments (developer laptops, testing servers, production).

## üöÄ Why Use Docker?

*   **Consistency:** Eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem. Containers run the same regardless of the underlying host OS or configuration.
*   **Isolation:** Containers run in isolated environments, preventing conflicts between applications or dependencies on the same host machine.
*   **Portability:** Build an image once and run it anywhere Docker is installed (local machine, cloud providers, on-premises servers).
*   **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines (VMs) as they share the host OS kernel. They start faster and use fewer resources.
*   **Scalability:** Easy to scale applications by running multiple instances of the same container image.
*   **DevOps & CI/CD:** Simplifies building, testing, and deploying applications in automated pipelines.
*   **Microservices:** A fundamental technology for building and deploying microservice architectures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation / Setup

1.  **Download Docker Desktop:** The easiest way to get Docker on Windows and macOS.
    *   Go to [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
    *   Download the installer for your operating system.
    *   **Windows:** Requires WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2). The Docker Desktop installer will usually prompt you to install/enable it if needed. Follow the on-screen instructions, which may involve enabling virtualization in your BIOS/UEFI and installing the WSL kernel update. A system restart is often required.
    *   **macOS:** Requires macOS version 11 (Big Sur) or newer. Follow the standard application installation process (drag to Applications folder).
    *   **Linux:** Docker Engine is typically installed via the distribution's package manager. Follow the official instructions for your specific distro: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (e.g., for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora). You might also need to add your user to the `docker` group: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` (log out and back in afterwards).

2.  **Run Docker Desktop:** Launch the application after installation. It runs in the background, managing containers and images. You'll typically see a whale icon in your system tray or menu bar.

3.  **Verification:**
    *   Open your terminal (PowerShell, Git Bash, macOS Terminal, Linux Terminal).
    *   Run the following commands:
        ```bash
        docker --version 
        docker compose version # Checks if Docker Compose V2 is installed (usually included with Docker Desktop)
        docker run hello-world # Downloads and runs a simple test image
        ```
    *   If the `hello-world` container runs successfully, Docker is installed correctly.

## üí° Getting Started

### 1. Key Concepts

*   **Image:** A read-only template containing the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies needed to run an application. Images are built from a `Dockerfile`.
*   **Container:** A runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, and delete containers. Containers are isolated but can communicate with each other or the host machine via networking.
*   **Dockerfile:** A text file containing instructions on how to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, commands to install dependencies, copy application code, expose ports, and define the startup command.
*   **Docker Hub / Registries:** A cloud-based registry service (like Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, Google Container Registry) where Docker images can be stored and shared.
*   **Volume:** A mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Volumes are managed by Docker and exist outside the container's writable layer.
*   **Bind Mount:** Mounts a file or directory from the host machine directly into a container. Useful for development when you want code changes on the host to reflect immediately inside the container.
*   **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes.

### 2. Basic Docker Commands

```bash
# Build an image from a Dockerfile in the current directory
docker build -t my-image-name:tag . 

# List local images
docker images

# Run a container from an image
# -d: run detached (in background)
# -p host_port:container_port: map ports
# --name container_name: assign a name
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-web-app my-image-name:tag

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# Stop a running container
docker stop my-web-app 
# or
docker stop <container_id>

# Start a stopped container
docker start my-web-app

# Remove a stopped container
docker rm my-web-app

# Remove an image
docker rmi my-image-name:tag

# View logs of a running container
docker logs my-web-app 
# Add -f to follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f my-web-app

# Execute a command inside a running container
docker exec -it my-web-app bash # Opens an interactive bash shell
```

### 3. Example Dockerfile (Simple Python/FastAPI App)

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim 

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
# Use uv if preferred and installed in the base image or via multi-stage build
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt 

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches using uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"] 
```

### 4. Using Docker Compose (Example `docker-compose.yml`)

```yaml
version: '3.8' # Specify compose file version

services: # Define the services (containers)
  web: # Name of the service
    build: . # Build the image from the Dockerfile in the current directory
    ports:
      - "8000:80" # Map host port 8000 to container port 80
    volumes:
      - .:/app # Mount current directory into /app (good for development)
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase
    depends_on: # Specify dependencies between services
      - db

  db: # Another service named 'db'
    image: postgres:15 # Use official PostgreSQL image
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Persist database data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password

volumes: # Define named volumes
  postgres_data: 
```
*   Run with: `docker compose up -d` (starts services in detached mode)
*   Stop with: `docker compose down` (stops and removes containers, networks)
